<Update label="Talos 1.11" description="v1.11.0" tags={["Talos"]}>

For critical changes, refer to the upgrade notes.

## Important Changes

### Kubernetes Version Validation

Talos now validates Kubernetes version in the image submitted in the machine configuration for compatibility.
Previously this check was performed only on upgrade, but now it is consistently applied to upgrade, initial provisioning, and machine configuration updates.
The default image references have the version tag, e.g. `ghcr.io/siderolabs/kubelet:v1.33.0`, which is used for validation.

This implies that all image references should contain the tag, even if the image is pinned by digest (e.g. `ghcr.io/siderolabs/kubelet:v1.33.0@sha256:0072b6738306b927cb85ad53999c2f9691f2f533cff22f4afc30350c3b9e62bb`).

## Disk Management

### Raw and Existing Volumes

In addition to the existing support for user volumes, Talos now supports two new types of volumes:

* raw volumes - allows to allocate unformatted disk space as a partition.
* existing volumes - allows to use existing data partitions or disks.

### Swap and Zswap

Talos now supports swap on block devices, and `zswap`, a compressed cache for swap pages.

### Disk Encryption

Disk encryption for system volumes is now managed by the `VolumeConfig` machine configuration document.
Legacy configuration in `v1alpha1` (`.machine.systemDiskEncryption`) machine configuration is still supported.

New per encryption key option `lockToSTATE` is added to the `VolumeConfig` document, which allows to lock the volume encryption key to the secret salt in the `STATE` volume.
So, if the `STATE` volume is wiped or replaced, the volume encryption key will not be usable anymore.

### Disk Wipe

Talos now supports `talosctl disk wipe` command in maintenance mode (`talosctl disk wipe <disk> --insecure`).

## SBOMs

Talos now publishes Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in the SPDX format.

## `etcd`

The default version of `etcd` in Talos is now 3.6.4.

As `etcd` 3.6.x introduce a new storage format, Talos now supports the `etcd` downgrade API to allow downgrading the `etcd` cluster (storage format) to a previous version
if downgrading to 3.5.x is required.

## Platform Updates

### Azure

Talos on Azure now defaults to MTU of 1400 bytes for the `eth0` interface to avoid packet fragmentation issues.
The default MTU can be overridden with machine configuration.

### VMware

Talos VMWare platform now supports `arm64` architecture in addition to `amd64`.

## `talosctl cluster create` with QEMU on macOS

When using Apple Silicon, Talos now supports running the `talosctl cluster create` command with the QEMU provisioner on macOS.
This was previously only supported on Linux.
This feature allows to create a test Talos cluster on macOS using QEMU virtual machines, and use it to verify Talos configuration and features.

## Miscellaneous Changes

### Bootloader

Talos increases the default boot partition size to 2 GiB to accommodate larger images (with many system extensions included).
On UEFI systems with `systemd-boot` (default since Talos 1.10), Talos now installs itself correctly into the UEFI boot order.

### New Resources

Talos Linux now provides several new resources for inspecting the system state:

* the kernel command line as a `KernelCmdline` resource (`talosctl get cmdline`);
* the list of loaded modules as a `LoadedKernelModule` resource (`talosctl get modules`);
* the booted entry (for `systemd-boot`) as a `BootedEntry` resource (`talosctl get bootedentry`).

### IMA support removed

Talos now drops the IMA (Integrity Measurement Architecture) support.
This feature was not used in Talos for any meaningful security purpose
and has historically caused performance issues.

### Early Inline Configuration

Talos now supports passing early inline configuration via the `talos.config.early` kernel parameter.
This allows to pass the configuration before the platform config source is probed, which is useful for early boot configuration.
The value of this parameter has same format as the `talos.config.inline` parameter, i.e. it should be base64 encoded and zstd-compressed.

## Breaking Changes

### UEFI Boot

Talos 1.10 now uses the `systemd-boot` bootloader and [Unified Kernel Images (UKIs)](https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/unified_kernel_image/) for UEFI systems.
Previously, this was limited to Secure Boot systems.
Upgrades from Talos 1.9 retain the existing bootloader, so this applies only to fresh installations.

UKIs bundle the kernel, initramfs, and kernel command line arguments into a single file, making kernel arguments unmodifiable without upgrading the UKI.
Consequently, the `.machine.install.extraKernelArgs` field in the machine config is ignored when using `systemd-boot`.

Ensure the correct platform-specific `installer` image is used during upgrades or installations, as it includes Talos-specific `talos.platform` arguments.
Tools like [Image Factory](https://factory.talos.dev/) and [Omni](https://www.siderolabs.com/platform/saas-for-kubernetes/) handle this automatically.
Image Factory now supports `<platform>-installer` images (e.g., `aws-installer` for Amazon EC2) with the appropriate kernel arguments.

### System Extensions

Starting with Talos 1.10, `.machine.install.extensions` is deprecated and has no effect.
The field remains for compatibility with older versions.
Use Boot Assets instead.
The `installer` image is now smaller as tools for host-side extension installation have been removed.

### `cgroups` v1

Talos no longer supports `cgroupsv1` in non-container mode.
The kernel argument `talos.unified_cgroup_hierarchy` is ignored.

> Note: Talos has defaulted to `cgroups` v2 for a long time, so this change should not impact most users.

## New Features

### User Volumes

Talos introduces user disk volumes via the `UserVolumeConfig` machine config.
The `.machine.disks` field is deprecated but remains for backward compatibility.

### Driver Rebind

A new machine config, `PCIDriverRebindConfig`, allows rebinding PCI device drivers to different targets.

### Ethernet Configuration

Talos now supports `ethtool`-style Ethernet configuration via `EthernetConfig`.
Interface status can be checked with `talosctl get ethernetstatus`.

### Dual-Boot Disk Images and ISOs

For x86, Talos provides dual-boot disk and ISO images that use GRUB for legacy BIOS and `systemd-boot` for UEFI.
On first boot, Talos determines the boot method and removes the unused bootloader.

For arm64, Talos now uses `systemd-boot`.
Secure Boot images exclusively use `systemd-boot` as Secure Boot is UEFI-only.

Imager supports bootloader selection when generating disk images:

```yaml
output:
  kind: image
  imageOptions:
    bootloader: sd-boot # supported options are sd-boot, grub, dual-boot
```

### SELinux

Talos Linux by default now ships an experimental SELinux policy which protects the base operating system from unauthorized access.
The default SELinux mode is `permissive`, meaning that violations are logged but not enforced.
See SELinux for details.

## Component Updates

* Linux: 6.12.24
* CNI plugins: 1.6.2
* runc: 1.2.6
* containerd: 2.0.5
* etcd: 3.5.20
* Flannel: 0.26.7
* Kubernetes: 1.33.0
* CoreDNS: 1.12.1

Talos is built with Go 1.24.2.

## Other Changes

### auditd

Disable Talos' built-in `auditd` service using the kernel parameter `talos.auditd.disabled=1`.

### iSCSI Initiator

Talos now generates `/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi` based on node identity, ensuring a deterministic IQN.
Update iSCSI targets to use the new IQN, which can be read with `talosctl read /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi`.

### NVMe NQN

Talos generates `/etc/nvme/hostnqn` and `/etc/nvme/hostid` based on node identity.
The NQN can be read with `talosctl read /etc/nvme/hostnqn`.

### Ingress Firewall

The Ingress Firewall now correctly filters access to Kubernetes NodePort services.

### `kube-apiserver` Authorization Config

The `.cluster.apiServer.authorizationConfig` field now respects the user-defined order of authorizers.
If `Node` and `RBAC` are not explicitly specified, they are appended to the end.

Example:

```yaml
cluster:
  apiServer:
    authorizationConfig:
      - type: Node
        name: Node
      - type: Webhook
        name: Webhook
        webhook:
          connectionInfo:
            type: InClusterConfig
        ...
      - type: RBAC
        name: rbac
```

The `authorization-mode` CLI argument does not support this customization.

### Fully Bootstrapped Builds

Talos 1.10 is built using [[StageË£]](https://stagex.tools/), enhancing reproducibility, auditability, and security.
The root filesystem now uses a unified `/usr` structure, with other directories symlinking to `/usr/bin` and `/usr/lib`.
Third-party extensions must adjust their directories accordingly.
