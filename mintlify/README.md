## docs-mint

This is just a simple docker container that contains the [`mint` command line](https://mintlify.com/docs/installation).

It is built via GitHub actions and published on ghcr.io/siderolabs/docs-mint

If Mintlify build and maintain their own published container we can drop this package.
