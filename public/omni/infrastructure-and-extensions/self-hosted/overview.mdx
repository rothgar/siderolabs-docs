Omni is available as a hosted version operated by Sidero Labs, but can also be self-hosted. This is appropriate for:

* air-gapped deployments
* industries with strict security and compliance concerns
* home use.

Note that using Omni for production use requires a commercial license. Contact [sales@SideroLabs.com](mailto:sales@siderolabs.com) for more information. Non-production use, such as using Omni for a home lab, does not require a license.
