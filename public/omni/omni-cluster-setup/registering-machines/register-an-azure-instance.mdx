### Dashboard <a href="#dashboard" id="dashboard"></a>

Upon logging in you will be presented with the Omni dashboard.

### Download the Image <a href="#download-the-image" id="download-the-image"></a>

Download the Azure image from the Omni portal by clicking on the “Download Installation Media” button. Click on the “Options” dropdown menu and search for the “Azure” option. Notice there are two options: one for `amd64` and another for `arm64`. Select the appropriate architecture for the machine you are registering, then click the “Download” button.

Once downloaded to your local machine, untar with `tar -xvf /path/to/image`

### Upload the Image <a href="#upload-the-image" id="upload-the-image"></a>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="UI">
    In the Azure console, navigate to `Storage accounts`, and create a new storage account. Once the account is provisioned, navigate to the resource and click `Upload`. In the `Upload Blob` form, select `Create New` container, and name your container (e.g. `omni-may-2023`). Now click `Browse for Files`, and select the `disk.vhd` file that you uncompressed above, then select `Upload`.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI">

    We’ll make use of the following environment variables throughout the setup. Edit the variables below with your correct information.

    ```bash
    # Storage account to use
    export STORAGE_ACCOUNT="StorageAccountName"

    # Storage container to upload to
    export STORAGE_CONTAINER="StorageContainerName"

    # Resource group name
    export GROUP="ResourceGroupName"

    # Location
    export LOCATION="centralus"

    # Get storage account connection string based on info above
    export CONNECTION=$(az storage account show-connection-string \
                        -n $STORAGE_ACCOUNT \
                        -g $GROUP \
                        -o tsv)
    ```

    You can upload the image you uncompressed to blob storage with:

    ```bash
    az storage blob upload \
      --connection-string $CONNECTION \
      --container-name $STORAGE_CONTAINER \
      -f /path/to/extracted/disk.vhd \
      -n omni-azure.vhd
    ```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>

### Convert the Image <a href="#convert-the-image" id="convert-the-image"></a>

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="UI">
    In the Azure console select `Images`, and then `Create`. Select a Resource Group, Name your image (e.g. omni-may), and set the OS type to Linux. Now `Browse` to the storage blob created above, navigating to the container with the uploaded `disk.vhd`. Select “Standard HDD” for account type, then click `Review and Create`, then `Create`.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI">
    Now that the image is present in our blob storage, we’ll register it.

    ```bash
    az image create \
      --name omni \
      --source https://$STORAGE_ACCOUNT.blob.core.windows.net/$STORAGE_CONTAINER/omni-azure.vhd \
      --os-type linux \
      -g $GROUP
    ```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>

### Create an Azure Instance <a href="#create-an-azure-instance" id="create-an-azure-instance"></a>

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="CLI">
    Creating an instance requires setting the os-disk-size property, which is easiest to achieve via the CLI:

    ```bash
    az vm create \
        --name azure-worker \
        --image omni \
        -g $GROUP \
        --admin-username talos \
        --generate-ssh-keys \
        --verbose \
        --os-disk-size-gb 20
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Conclusion <a href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"></a>

In the Omni UI, navigate to the “Machines” menu in the sidebar. You should now see the Azure machine that was created listed as an available machine, registered with Omni and ready to provision.
