### Dashboard <a href="#dashboard" id="dashboard"></a>

Upon logging in you will be presented with the Omni dashboard.

### Download the Hetzner Image <a href="#download-the-hetzner-image" id="download-the-hetzner-image"></a>

First, download the Hetzner image from the Omni portal by clicking on the “Download Installation Media” button. Now, click on the “Options” dropdown menu and search for the “Hetzner” option. Notice there are two options: one for `amd64` and another for `arm64`. Select the appropriate option for the machine you are registering. Now, click the “Download” button.

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Packer">
    Place the following in the same directory as the downloaded installation media and name the file `hcloud.pkr.hcl`:

    Copy

    ```hcl
    packer {
      required_plugins {
        hcloud = {
          version = ">= 1.0.0"
          source  = "github.com/hashicorp/hcloud"
        }
      }
    }

    locals {
      image = "<path to downloaded installation media>"
    }

    source "hcloud" "talos" {
      rescue       = "linux64"
      image        = "debian-11"
      location     = "hel1"
      server_type  = "cx11"
      ssh_username = "root"

      snapshot_name = "Omni Image"
    }

    build {
      sources = ["source.hcloud.talos"]

      provisioner "file" {
        source = "${local.image}"
        destination = "/tmp/talos.raw.xz"
      }

      provisioner "shell" {
        inline = [
          "xz -d -c /tmp/talos.raw.xz | dd of=/dev/sda && sync",
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    Now, run the following:

    ```bash
    export HCLOUD_TOKEN=${TOKEN}
    packer init .
    packer build .
    ```

    Take note of the image ID produced by running this command.
  </Tab>
