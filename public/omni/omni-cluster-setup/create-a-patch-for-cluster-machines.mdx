title: Create a Patch For Cluster Machines
---

Omni allows you to create patches and target the patches to all members of a cluster; all control plane nodes; all worker nodes; or specific machines. Upon logging in, click the “Clusters” menu item on the left. Now, select “Config Patches” from the menu under the ellipsis:

(You can also navigate to the specific cluster, and then select Config Patches in the right hand menu.)

Next, click “Create Patch”:

Pick the specific machine or class of machines from the “Patch Target” dropdown:

Type in the desired config patch:

Click “Save” to create the config patch.

For an example of a patch to enable node-to-node network encryption - the KubeSpan feature of Talos Linux - see [Creating a Hybrid Cluster](../cluster-management/create-a-hybrid-cluster).
