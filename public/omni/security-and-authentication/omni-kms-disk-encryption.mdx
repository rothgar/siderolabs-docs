title: Omni KMS Disk Encryption
---

Starting from 1.5.0, Talos supports KMS (Key Management Server) disk encryption key types. KMS keys are randomly generated on the Talos node and then sealed using the KMS server. A sealed key is stored in the `luks2` metadata. To decrypt a disk, Talos node needs to communicate with the KMS server and decrypt the sealed key. The KMS server endpoint is defined in the key configuration.

If the `Cluster` resource has `diskencryption` enabled, Omni creates a config patch for each cluster machine and sets key's KMS endpoint to the Omni gRPC API. Each disk encryption key is sealed using an AES256 key managed by Omni:

* Omni generates a random AES256 key for a machine when it is allocated.
* When the machine is wiped the encryption key is deleted.

<Warning>
KMS encryption makes cluster more sensitive to Omni downtime. A node must be able to reach Omni when it is restarted in order to unseal the disk encryption key.
