description: "List of unofficial ports of Talos Linux to single-board computers."

All single-board computer (SBC) ports are community-maintained and provided as-is.
They are not part of the official Talos Linux source tree and live in the [overlays repository](https://github.com/siderolabs/overlays).

While Talos contributors may offer best-effort help for Talos-specific issues (for example, if Kubernetes doesnâ€™t run properly on a supported architecture), we do not provide official support for SBC-specific problems such as boot failures, firmware quirks, or custom kernel requirements.

If you need official support for SBC boards please contact sales@siderolabs.com to discuss a support contract.
