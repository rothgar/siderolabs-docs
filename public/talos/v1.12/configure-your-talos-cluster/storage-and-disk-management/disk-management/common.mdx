Several configuration documents share common elements for configuring volumes in Talos Linux:

* [`VolumeConfig`](../../../reference/configuration/block/volumeconfig)
* [`UserVolumeConfig`](../../../reference/configuration/block/uservolumeconfig)
* [`RawVolumeConfig`](../../../reference/configuration/block/rawvolumeconfig)
* [`SwapVolumeConfig`](../../../reference/configuration/block/swapvolumeconfig)

## Disk Selector

The `diskSelector` field is utilized to choose the disk where the volume will be provisioned.
It is a [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://cel.dev/) expression that evaluates against the available disks.
The volume will be provisioned on the first disk that matches the expression and has sufficient free space for the volume.

The expression is evaluated in the following context:

* `system_disk` (`bool`) - indicates if the disk is the system disk
* `disk` (`Disks.block.talos.dev`) - the disk resource being evaluated

> Note: The `system_disk` variable is only populated after Talos installation, so you might see an error about `system_disk` not being defined
> before installation finishes.

For the disk resource, any field available in the resource specification can be used (use `talosctl get disks -o yaml` to see the output for your machine):

```yaml
dev_path: /dev/nvme0n1
size: 10485760000
pretty_size: 10 GB
io_size: 512
sector_size: 512
readonly: false
cdrom: false
model: QEMU NVMe Ctrl
serial: deadbeef
wwid: nvme.1b36-6465616462656566-51454d55204e564d65204374726c-00000001
bus_path: /pci0000:00/0000:00:09.0/nvme
sub_system: /sys/class/block
transport: nvme
symlinks:
    - /dev/disk/by-diskseq/11
    - /dev/disk/by-id/ata-QEMU_HARDDISK_QM00001
    - /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:1f.2-ata-1
    - /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:1f.2-ata-1.0
```

Additionally, constants for disk size multipliers are available:

* `KiB`, `MiB`, `GiB`, `TiB`, `PiB`, `EiB` - binary size multipliers (1024)
* `kB`, `MB`, `GB`, `TB`, `PB`, `EB` - decimal size multipliers (1000)

The disk expression is evaluated against each available disk, and the expression should either return `true` or `false`.
If the expression returns `true`, the disk is selected for provisioning.

> Note: In CEL, signed and unsigned integers are not interchangeable.
> Disk sizes are represented as unsigned integers, so suffix `u` should be used in constants to avoid type mismatch, e.g. `disk.size > 10u * GiB`.

Examples of disk selector expressions:

* `disk.transport == 'nvme'`: select the NVMe disks only
* `disk.transport == 'scsi' && disk.size < 2u * TiB`: select SCSI disks smaller than 2 TiB
* `disk.serial.startsWith('deadbeef') && !cdrom`: select disks with serial number starting with `deadbeef` and not of CD-ROM type
* `'/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:1f.2-ata-1' in disk.symlinks`: select disks with a specific stable symlink

### Minimum, Maximum and Grow

The `minSize` and `maxSize` fields define the minimum and maximum size of the volume, respectively.
Talos Linux will always ensure that the volume is at least `minSize` in size and will not exceed `maxSize`.
If `maxSize` is not set, the volume will grow to utilize the maximum available space on the disk.

The `grow` flag controls what happens when the volume already exists:

* **On initial creation:** `grow` is ignored. The new volume is created between `minSize` and `maxSize` (or full disk if `maxSize` is unset).
* **On subsequent boots (when the volume already exists):**
  * If `grow: false`, the existing volume size is never changed.
  * If `grow: true`, and the current volume is smaller than `maxSize` (or `maxSize` is unset), Talos will expand the volume to fill available space after it.

Setting `minSize` might influence disk selection - if the disk does not have enough free space to satisfy the minimum size requirement, it will not be selected for provisioning.

## Volume Selector

The `volumeSelector` field is a CEL expression that allows you to match existing volumes based on their properties.
It is evaluated against the available volumes, and the first volume that matches the expression will be picked up.

The expression is evaluated in the following context:

* `volume` (`DiscoveredVolumes.block.talos.dev`) - the volume resource being evaluated
* `disk` (`Disks.block.talos.dev`) - the disk resource where the volume is located

For the `disk` field, see [Disk Selector](#disk-selector) above.
For the `volume` field, any field available in the resource specification can be used (use `talosctl get discoveredvolumes -o yaml` to see the output for your machine):

```yaml
metadata:
    namespace: runtime
    type: DiscoveredVolumes.block.talos.dev
    id: vda4
    version: 1
    owner: block.DiscoveryController
    phase: running

    uuid: 2f115241-781f-4817-a373-fc957d63326f
    label: EPHEMERAL
    block_size: 512
    filesystem_block_size: 4096
    probed_size: 5112856576
    partition_uuid: 73111630-87ed-4aad-bffb-af6d0f55ab3c
    partition_type: 0fc63daf-8483-4772-8e79-3d69d8477de4
    partition_label: EPHEMERAL
    partition_index: 4
```

The size multipliers constants are also available for the volume selector expression.

Examples of volume selector expressions:

* `volume.partition_label == 'MY-DATA'`: match volumes with partition label `MY-DATA`
* `volume.name == 'xfs' && volume.size > 1000u * TB`: match XFS volumes larger than 1000 TB
* `volume.name == 'xfs' && disk.transport == 'nvme'`: match XFS volumes on NVMe disks
* `volume.partition_index == 2 && disk.serial == 'SERIAL123'`: match second partition on a disk with serial number `SERIAL123`
