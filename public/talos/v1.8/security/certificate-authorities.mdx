## Appending the Certificate Authority (CA)

Append additional certificate authorities to the system's trusted certificate store by [patching](../configure-your-talos-cluster/system-configuration/patching) the machine configuration with the following
[document](../reference/configuration/security/trustedrootsconfig):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: TrustedRootsConfig
name: custom-ca
certificates: |-
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Multiple documents can be appended, and multiple CA certificates might be present in each configuration document.

This configuration can be also applied in maintenance mode.
